# EarthQuake-API

This is a earthquake api. I used AFAD's official web site for real data. AFAD's Web Site is https://deprem.afad.gov.tr/last-earthquakes.html

You can use the API and get live earthquake's data in Turkey. The list get data of 100 record. And I added Postman Collection for you. For the time being, it has 1 endpoint for get list method.
